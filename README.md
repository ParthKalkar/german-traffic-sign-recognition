In this project, I do the classic GTSRB problem from kaggle using a CNN model. 

## German traffic sign recognition
Imagine you are working in self-driving project as a machine learning engineer. One of the important problems for self-driving cars is to follow traffic signs. A car moves and collects video from the front camera. In each separate image you could localize the signs and after that understand what sign did we find.

We can assume that someone else is responsible for localizing and tracking signs, and your task is to do the classification part.

In today's lab you will be asked to develop a traffic sign recognition system. It should take a sign image and classify which of 43 signs it belongs to.

In this problem you will be given a benchmark dataset The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A multi-class classification competition.

## Overview

multi-class classification problem
More than 40 classes
More than 50,000 images in total
Large, lifelike database
Reliable ground-truth data due to semi-automatic annotation Physical traffic sign instances are unique within the dataset (i.e., each real-world traffic sign only occurs once)
